# snimach-web

Landing page and release notes for Snimach.

A small server renders the pages once at boot from the GitHub releases API,
keeps them in memory, and refreshes them every 30 minutes. HTML is served with
a short cache lifetime, the embedded assets are fingerprinted so they can be
cached for a year, and `/download` redirects to the latest DMG.

## Run locally

```sh
cargo run
```

Serves on `http://localhost:3000`.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Listen port |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | `infomiho/snimach` | Repository to read releases from |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | unset | Raises the GitHub API rate limit |
| `SITE_URL` | `https://snimach.miho.dev` | Absolute URLs in meta tags |

## Generated assets

Keep `static/` in sync with its sources:

- `static/snimach-mark.svg` and `static/snimach.webp` from
  `./web/scripts/sync-app-assets.sh`
- `static/og.png` from `./web/scripts/render-og.sh`. Set `CHROME` if Chrome is
  not at the default macOS path.

## Deploy

Built from `web/Dockerfile` with `web/` as the build context. Coolify injects
`PORT`.
