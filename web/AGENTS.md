Landing page and release notes for Snimach, an axum app. Read the root
`AGENTS.md` first.

## Architecture

The site is **prerendered**: pages are rendered from the GitHub releases API at
boot, held in memory, and refreshed every 30 minutes.

Cache in three tiers:

- Assets carry a content **fingerprint** (`?v=` hashed over every embedded
  asset) and are served `immutable, max-age=1y`.
- HTML is served `max-age=300`.
- `/download` is `no-store` and 302s to the latest DMG. Point the home download
  button at it, so a cached page never offers an old build.

Set `SITE_URL` to the canonical origin; meta tags use it.

## Design

The **palette** is the app's, not a generic Apple one: paper, ink and the orange
diagonal from `Sources/SnimachCore/Document/Brand.swift`, one `light-dark()` per
token with `color-scheme: light dark` on `:root`. Draw any new color from it.

System font stack. Reach for modern CSS before adding markup: `light-dark()`,
`clamp()`, logical properties, `text-wrap`, `:focus-visible`,
`@media (hover: hover)`, `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Body headings are demoted one level so they nest under the release title: one
`h1`, release titles `h2`, body `h3` and deeper. Decorative images take empty
`alt`.

## Assets are derived

The build context is `web/`, so everything the build needs lives here. Keep
`static/` synced from its sources rather than editing the copies:

- `static/snimach-mark.svg` and `static/snimach.webp` from
  `./scripts/sync-app-assets.sh`, which copies the repo `assets/` files.
- `static/og.png` from `./scripts/render-og.sh`, which captures
  `scripts/card.html`.

Regenerate after changing a source.

## Code

- Handlers return a response for every input: a bad redirect target falls back
  to `releases/latest` rather than panicking.
- Release bodies are maintainer-authored, so raw HTML passes through.
- Upstream URLs live in `github.rs` as the single source of truth.

## Deploy

`web/Dockerfile`, build context `web/`. Pin the builder and runtime to the same
Debian suite to keep glibc aligned.

Coolify: Base Directory `/web`, Dockerfile Location `/Dockerfile`, port 3000,
health check `/healthz`. A `v*` tag runs the release workflow, which calls the
Coolify webhook (`COOLIFY_WEBHOOK`, `COOLIFY_TOKEN`) to rebuild the site.

## Validate

```sh
cargo fmt --manifest-path web/Cargo.toml -- --check
cargo clippy --manifest-path web/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --manifest-path web/Cargo.toml
```
